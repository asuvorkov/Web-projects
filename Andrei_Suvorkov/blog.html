            <p class="post_text">Since, because of the need to move from Munich to Frankfurt, I had to leave work in the
                <a class="post_link" href="http://www.socialsweethearts.de/en_US/">social sweethearts GmbH</a>, where I
                have worked as software tester, namely websites testing, I also had to look for a new job in Frankfurt
                area. I sent out a dozen letters to companies, on which I was interested in, and in almost all of them I
                received an invitation for an interview. In the interview, I learned about these companies, their
                working conditions and my future responsibilities. After a couple of weeks of interviews with all of
                them, I have started receiving job offers from companies. One of them was this company.</p>
            <p class="post_text">The choice fell on this company because I liked the working conditions, the team and
                the tasks very much, besides, I had long wanted to develop a large project in Java using the Spring
                framework and a very big database. This company is part of the largest exchange for the sale of books in
                Germany, which will undoubtedly give an opportunity to participate in a complex and interesting project
                and gain a lot of invaluable experience in the development of industrial software.</p>

            <p class="post_text">The <a class="post_link" href="http://www.hs-rm.de/en/">University of Applied Sciences RainMain</a> is located in the federal state of Hessen in its capital city of Wiesbaden, the same campus of computer science is located on the outskirts of the city right in the forest, which I was simply amazed. For the first time in my life I have seen a university that is literally in the woods and it is just wonderful! Forest clean fresh air and the beauty of autumn forest perfectly complement the school day on campus.</p>
            <p class="post_text">In this semester I have five subjects, namely: object-oriented programming, discrete mathematics, analysis and numeric, computer science and economics. The training is structured as follows: there are lectures and practical classes for each of the subjects, as well as for those who are lagging behind or interested in additional information, there is the opportunity to attend additional classes with senior students.</p>
            <p class="post_text">There are relatively few students at the university, for example, about 80 people in our stream. I think this is very good, because in small groups friendships with students are faster established, rather than in a group of more than 1000 students. The professors are very motivated and trying to present the material as simply as possible for everyone, the task of the students is already to study this material.</p>
            <p class="post_text">What distinguishes the University of Applied Sciences from the classical university, so it is a deviation to practice. Since the first semester in each subject, we have practical classes, where the professors show us how the knowledge received at the lecture is applied in practice. By the end of this semester, we will develop three small programming projects, in addition to weekly programming assignments.</p>
